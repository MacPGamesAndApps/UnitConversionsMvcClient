# Currently deployed:
Hosted on Azure => (https://macpconversionsmvcclient.azurewebsites.net/UnitConversions/UnitConversionsPage)

# UnitConversionsMvcClient
A simple single-page MVC app that uses my unit conversions microservice running locally on Docker Desktop for debugging. It can also be deployed to a production environment hosted on Internet or an intranet, and will need one code change to have the production endpoint that corresponds to the hosting environment.
